// pi-goal-list-loop-audit — v0.25.0
// extensions/goal-settings.ts
//
// The settings layer, extracted from loops/goal.ts so tests can drive it
// without importing the whole extension. Two-tier config (v0.7.0): GLOBAL
// is the normal home, PROJECT the rare local override. Resolution:
// project > global > defaults (per key).
//
// v0.35.6: this module owns the typed boundary for the long-term
// preferences policy (audit/LONG-TERM-PREFERENCES-POLICY-2026-08-19.md).
// The Settings interface is the ONLY schema accepted by saveSettings;
// natural-language conversation / completion / auditor / scout
// transcripts are NEVER written here. A regression in
// tests/long-term-preferences-boundary.test.ts pins this boundary.
